                <p>My introduction to Computer Science and programming came through ROBLOX, a very popular game creation platform. Since its development platform,
                    Roblox Studio, is very user friendly, I spent quite a lot of time making random things for me and my friends to play, which we would end up playing
                    for hours on end. It allowed me to explore my creative facets while also making something that people could enjoy.

                <p>Although I am still early on in my journey of learning Computer Science, there are a few main aspects that really intrigue me. UI/UX Design paired alongside
                    frontend development interests me with making websites and applications that are visually pleasing to the user, while also generally easy to 
                    navigate. Another key area I'd love to learn more about is program optimization and efficiency. Making programs that run on any sort of hardware without 
                    lag or delays is something I'd love to work on, making sure that products are accessible to all.
